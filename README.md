# Quickly check or uncheck View Layer's Use For Rendering property !

Enabling and disabling View Layers when setting up your compositing nodes can be annoying as it requieres you to switch to every and each view layer to access this option, but is necessary when you only want to render a few layers without having to wait for all of them.

This addon resolves this inconvenience by discretly inserting the 3 following operators:

1. Disable all view layers
2. Enable all view layers
3. Enable only active render layers nodes corresponding view layers

Note: the third operator, also supports multiple scenes and disables view layers everywhere. It also takes into account if your render layers are muted or active. Simply mute unwanted render layers and press the button. Now only your active render layers will render.

Good Blending :)
