# Quickly check or uncheck View Layer's _Use For Rendering_ property !

Enabling and disabling View Layers when setting up your compositing nodes can be annoying as it requieres you to switch to every and each View Layer to access this option, but is necessary when you only want to render a few layers without having to wait for all of them.

# OPERATORS
This addon resolves this inconvenience by discretly inserting the 5 following operators:

1. Enable all view layers

    ![icon_checked](/src/images/icon_checked.png)

2. Disable all view layers

    ![icon_unchecked](/src/images/icon_unchecked.png)

3. Enable view layers for unmuted render layers only

    ![icon_unmuted](/src/images/icon_unmuted.png)

4. Enable view layers for selected render layers only

    ![icon_selected](/src/images/icon_selected.png)

5. (Bonus) Switch to view layer of the selected render layer

    ![icon_switch](/src/images/icon_switch.png)


# INTERFACE
You can find these operators under the compositor nodes header:

![icon_selected](/presentation/presentation_menu.png)

In the contextual menu:

![icon_selected](/presentation/presentation_contextual.png)

In the view layer property panel:

![icon_selected](/presentation/presentation_view_layer.png)



Good Blending :)
